# image-compression-svd-pca

Cerinta 1 </br>  Reduced singular value decomposition for a black and white image stored in a matrix.
  
Cerinta 2   Generates graphics for: singular values, approximation error, data compression ratio.
  
Cerinta 3   Calculates the principal components (PC) of a matrix using the SVD method.
  
Cerinta 4   Calculates the principal components (PC) of a matrix using an algorithm based on the covariance matrix.

Cerinta 5   Generates graphics for: diagonal matrix, info given by the first k singular values, approximation error, data compression ratio.
